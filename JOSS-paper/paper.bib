  abstract     = {The development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques has defined modern neuroimaging. Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS standard uses file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of practices already common in the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.},

  abstract     = {Magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (M/EEG) measure the weak electromagnetic signals generated by neuronal activity in the brain. Using these signals to characterize and locate neural activation in the brain is a challenge that requires expertise in physics, signal processing, statistics, and numerical methods. As part of the MNE software suite, MNE-Python is an open-source software package that addresses this challenge by providing state-of-the-art algorithms implemented in Python that cover multiple methods of data  preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner  with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. Moreover, MNE-Python is tightly integrated with the core Python libraries for scientific comptutation (Numpy, Scipy) and visualization (matplotlib and Mayavi), as well as the greater neuroimaging ecosystem in Python  via the Nibabel package. The code is provided under the new BSD license allowing code reuse, even in commercial products. Although MNE-Python has only been under heavy development for a couple of years, it has rapidly evolved with expanded analysis capabilities and pedagogical tutorials because multiple  labs have collaborated during code development to help share best practices. MNE-Python also gives easy access to preprocessed datasets, helping users to get started quickly and facilitating reproducibility of methods by other researchers. Full documentation, including dozens of examples, is available at http://martinos.org/mne.},

  abstract     = {Electrophysiological research with event-related brain potentials (ERPs) is increasingly moving from simple, strictly orthogonal stimulation paradigms towards more complex, quasi-experimental designs and naturalistic situations that involve fast, multisensory stimulation and complex motor behavior. As a result, electrophysiological responses from subsequent events often overlap with each other. In addition, the recorded neural activity is typically modulated by numerous covariates, which influence the measured responses in a linear or non-linear fashion. Examples of paradigms where systematic temporal overlap variations and low-level confounds between conditions cannot be avoided include combined electroencephalogram (EEG)/eye-tracking experiments during natural vision, fast multisensory stimulation experiments, and mobile brain/body imaging studies. However, even “traditional,” highly controlled ERP datasets often contain a hidden mix of overlapping activity (e.g., from stimulus onsets, involuntary microsaccades, or button presses) and it is helpful or even necessary to disentangle these components for a correct interpretation of the results. In this paper, we introduce unfold, a powerful, yet easy-to-use MATLAB toolbox for regression-based EEG analyses that combines existing concepts of massive univariate modeling (“regression-ERPs”), linear deconvolution modeling, and non-linear modeling with the generalized additive model into one coherent and flexible analysis framework. The toolbox is modular, compatible with EEGLAB and can handle even large datasets efficiently. It also includes advanced options for regularization and the use of temporal basis functions (e.g., Fourier sets). We illustrate the advantages of this approach for simulated data as well as data from a standard face recognition experiment. In addition to traditional and non-conventional EEG/ERP designs, unfold can also be applied to other overlapping physiological signals, such as pupillary or electrodermal responses. It is available as open-source software at http://www.unfoldtoolbox.org.},

  abstract     = {ERP averaging is an extraordinarily successful method, but can only be applied to a limited range of experimental designs. We introduce the regression-based rERP framework, which extends ERP averaging to handle arbitrary combinations of categorical and continuous covariates, partial confounding, nonlinear effects, and overlapping responses to distinct events, all within a single unified system. rERPs enable a richer variety of paradigms (including high-N naturalistic designs) while preserving the advantages of traditional ERPs. This article provides an accessible introduction to what rERPs are, why they are useful, how they are computed, and when we should expect them to be effective, particularly in cases of partial confounding. A companion article discusses how nonlinear effects and overlap correction can be handled within this framework, as well as practical considerations around baselining, filtering, statistical testing, and artifact rejection.
